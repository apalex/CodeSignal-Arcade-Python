# You would like to write a function that takes
# integers x, y, L and R as parameters, and returns
# True of x^y lies within the interval (L, R] and
# False otherwise. You're considering several
# different ways to write the conditional statement
# inside the function:
# 1. if l < x ** y <= R:
# 2. if x ** y > L and x ** y <= R:
# 3. if x ** y in range(L + 1, R + 1)
# Which option would be the most efficient in terms
# of execution time?

# Answer: Option 1 is the most optimal one.
